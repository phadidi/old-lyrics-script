I’m feelin’ the wind in the sky
Without your love

From the crevices of the shredded sky,
rays of light leak out to guide me on my way.
Although I have been standing still,
I think I'm finally able to walk again.

There are two sets of footprints behind me.
When I try to recall, I remember
that you used to smile and kiss me.
But you are no longer here.

for Dear…
I’m feelin’ the wind in the sky
Without your love
About this time, are you also watching the sky, with someone? 
I’m feelin’ the wind in the sky
Without your love
I'll stash away our memories while they are still pretty.

Even if I try to force smiles on the outside,
I cannot lie my way into my dream.

My white breath spelled out "farewell".
The song flowing into my ears was quite sad,
so I subconsciously covered my ears.
It was the song you used to like.

for Dear…
I’m feelin’ the wind in the sky
Without your love
Please don't become more beautiful, as it will make me a wretched wreck.
I’m feelin’ the wind in the sky
Without your love
I just want to see you, but I can't, so I'll wish you to be happy.
