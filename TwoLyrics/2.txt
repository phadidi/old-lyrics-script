The moon is soaked in sadness
It quietly paints the land red and disappears

Can you hear my voice ?
Can I stay myself
In this bloodthirsty era ?

The tears that overflow your heart
Are surely proof of your wish for a future
Gaze forward without lamenting your current powerlessness
You can get it over
Over the clouds

The sound of the wind changes the seasons
It's the prelude to a fight that has no end in sight

Why do people forget
That our common, everyday lives
Hold precious things ?

If you still hold feelings for someone
Even though your wings have become tattered
You can fly away no matter what pain you might face
You can get it over
Over the clouds

Can you hear my voice ?
Can I stay myself
In this bloodthirsty era ?

The tears that overflow your heart
Are surely proof of your wish for a future
If you still hold feelings for someone
Even though your wings have become tattered
You can fly away no matter what pain you might face
You can get it over
Over the clouds
You can get it over
Over the clouds

The light of life is a flood of emotions
The light of life is lit in the dark night
